        Using unknown QR codes is a risk because we do not know what
        is hiding behind the link. Anyone can create a QR code with a malicious link.

    <p class="text">
        Donâ€™t worry, this page is totally safe! But think twice next
        time you scan a QR code or click an unknown link. When clicking links you should also verify that the domain
        name is well known.
        Similar domain names such as <span class="bouvet">bouvet.app</span> vs <span class="bouvet">bouvet.no</span> may
        be bought by anyone.
        Next time: think twice, double check domain and type in the URL manually if possible.
